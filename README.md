This is one of my first set of projects. I am currently a 3rd Year College Student studying Information Technology.
For this project I wanted to learn how to use HTML Canvas.
My goal for this project is to create a simple web site that can simulate video-game movements by using Canvas.
I did this project to enhance my knowledge about EventListeners, OOP, Animations, CSS, and HTML Canvas.
